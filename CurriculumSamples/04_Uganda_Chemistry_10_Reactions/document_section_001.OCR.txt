SENIOR TWO

TERM I


TOPIC 10: REACTIONS OF METALS WITH OXYGEN- REACTIVITY SERIES FOR METALS
DURATION: 6 Periods

GENERAL OBJECTIVE: By the end of this topic the learner should be able to arrange metals in order of their reactivity with oxygen and apply the principles to different situations.


SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE

Learners should be able to:
 Define the term affinity.
 Describe the reaction between a given metal and metal oxide.
 Explain the reaction between a given metal and metal oxide.
 State the order of elements in the reactivity series.



CONTENT
Definition of affinity for oxygen.
Displacement reactions.
Competition reactions of the metals for oxygen
Experiments to demonstrate the reactions of metals with metal oxides e.g. CO2/Mg, PbO/Mg 
The reactivity series ( K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, C,Zn)



TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES

 Conduct a guided discussion on the definition of affinity for oxygen.
 Carryout experiments to demonstrate displacement reactions between metals and different metal oxides.

 Brainstorm on the deductions made on the above experiments.
 Assign the learners project work of designing their reactivity series
based on the experiments carried out.
 Have a guided discussion on the recognized reactivity series.
